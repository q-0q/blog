# Wasp

Wasp is an open-source Finite State Machine Nuget package designed for use in game controllers.

Wasp is heavily inspired by [Stateless](https://github.com/dotnet-state-machine/stateless/tree/dev), and mirrors most of its patterns. I came across Stateless when looking for an FSM solution for my fighting game [Project SilverNeedle](../psn/index.md). Despite Stateless being one of the most popular FSM libraries, its source was ancient and bloated, and lacked crucial features I needed for my project; so, I decided to create my own library.

Wasp was designed specifically with PSN in mind, but it is an independent kernel that can be used in any context.
