Marching down from the jagged Teeth was a series of staggered stone escarpments that surrounded the base of the valley with high walls. The swathe of plain that carved through the lowest parts of the Hornblend was slick with downpour that dully shone in the dim nightlight. On the western side, an expansive copse of pines, darker than the sky, marched up the sloping fields right to the base of the cliffs, but through their sparse number pierced a bobbing torchlight.

A figure atop a horse was navigating the storm on a broken trail that wound down from the west. The gelding was black. His reigns were unshortened and his long black neck stretched low in front of him, heaving stern breaths as he moved. He was splattered with the burden of a journey, but carried his rider dutifully. The human wore black garments with little accoutrement, but his tall riding boots were crowned with metal knee plates, and a dark leather gun belt sat loosened around his waste. Tucked under one of his arms was a long crook affixed with a caged lamp, casting from high a dim flicker down onto them.

Time went on and the pines ended, leaving the duo fully open to the night rain that was starting to worsen. A voice was heard.

*"We couldn't last in these conditions,*" it spoke out. The rider continued for several paces before responding.

"I fear what we might encounter if we turn back. We can find refuge further within the vale if we hold out a little longer." The human dismounted and began leading the gelding on foot. They navigated this way for another hour, following ruined pavement stones into the open Hornblend. A dim aurora slowly had faded into view behind the storm clouds by the time they made camp. A mill had been spotted by the rider on the trek down into the valley, and he had thought to path in its direction.

It was a ruined watermill on a small brook. Inside the caved-in tower he pitched and sat, watching the continued downpour for a time. The aurora's pale glow reflecting off the slick stones mixed with the lamp to fill the ruins with vague visibility. Stacks of lasting slabs from the mill's walls cast long shadows out and down the small hill upon which the ruin sat. The ongoing roar of rain was finally accompanied when the voice came again. 

"*Well, we find ourselves united by circumstance. I fear maybe that circumstance could be the only thing we have in-common. But we at least do share our current thread. Circumstance I suppose, is the great uniter. Too bad about the rain. Oh, what a drag!*" It was a woman's voice that seemed to come from nowhere.

The man shifted before speaking. "I speak truth when I say I was taken aback by the opportunity to be in your company on this case. I admire your kind and you. But I fear I simply don't know how to talk to you."

"*No different than talking,*" the voice laughed.

"Please, enlighten me," he went on. "I want to know about, well, your origin, and how you came to be put with me."

There was a contemplative pause before the woman's voice again broke into mild laughter. "*I'm sure I couldn't tell you the entirety of it,*" she said. "*Most of my story I think does not matter to us, or to our circumstance, not yet. The tale would take you down below the ground and through the ages, over dark stone, and through fire. I was part of a great force once. But events changed us, you know. I allowed myself to be manipulated. I owed too many favors to powerful people, my debt caught up with me. That isn't to say I don't want to be here, though! I needed change. I have always desired to see the material world. I am viewing this whole experience as an adventure!*"

"If I may speak plainly, I feared I would be paired with someone much more hostile than you," the man responded hesitantly. "As you said, it's normally not a position that your kind opts-in to."

The voice did not immediately respond to this. The rider suddenly shifted again, seemingly aware of some great danger. He silently rose to a stand. Slowly putting his back to the wall of the mill, he calmly unholstered his pistol and gestured into the black. He pierced the darkness and identified the silhouette of a male moose stooping on a ridge that hugged the bank upstream. The massive animal bore a sinister crown that held the beasts head low in a wickedly predatory posture. Its powerful legs shifted impatiently.

They watched each other for a few seconds in silence before the moose began swaying its rack broadly, and snorting aggressively, while starting its way across the hilltop. It had just gotten up to full tilt when, without changing his stance, the man fired, sending out a raspy woman's scream from the muzzle of the weapon. A blue shot carved through the beast's left shoulder and torso, misting the ruin-stones in its gore. Its corpse collapsed at speed, further breaking its body with a crunch. The man stood fast, keeping the steaming barrel trained on the creature that now lay ten feet before him.

It was one of the early times the man witnessed the power that he carried. Nearly a quarter of the animal's body had been disintegrated. He lowered the weapon and held it in his gaze. 

The pistol was of a cerulean metal. The etched butt sat in the human's trembling hand, in front of which was a helical cylinder of six slugs with a tabular hammer. The long barrel stretched out in front of it with swooping curved lines, and forming its muzzle was the head of a female demon, mouth agape.

The roaring crack was still reverberating distantly across the valley when the voice came, now rashly enthusiastic, taking him out his trance.

"*Eus! Ca leung!*" She cackled wickedly in an infernal tongue. "*Great shot Balor! Foul thing thought it had us!*" The man turned the pistol in his gloved hands and opened the cylinder. Five of the engraved rounds glowed, one was now dim and steaming softly. He removed and replaced the spent shell. He felt a weariness befall him and he again slumped back against the stones.

"Suddenly, I've lost my breath," he said. The rain then slowed, leaving him newly aware of the  crickets droning around him. The dense, black storm clouds lingered in front of the stars, blanketing the land in a cold, shadowy mourning. He brought himself to his feet once more and began to prepare for riding. She spoke again.

"*Are we off so soon? You don't look so good after that*," she chimed. The words were fixed with an obsessive fascination, and her voice sounded suddenly as on a needle point. Neither said anything for a moment once again. 

"*The next-largest thing like that creature is miles from here. Anything that heard the blast would have gone running, anyways!*" Her voice brought him back down, laying back against a bed of grass. He dimmed the lamp with a quiet word and gazed up at the shifting clouds.
