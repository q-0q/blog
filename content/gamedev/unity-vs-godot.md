# Unity vs. Godot: David & Goliath

Feb 22, 2024

## The Unity fiasco
The Godot engine got a lot of attention last year following the [batshit crazy pricing changes](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development) Unity announced in September.

The company presented many changes to their pricing plans that were arguably malicious, but the most earth shaking announcement was the new "Unity Runtime Fee". Starting January 2024, developers were to be charged a flat rate (in most cases, $0.20) each time their game made with Unity was **downloaded**.

Not purchased, downloaded. Unity confirmed that [downloading, uninstalling, and redownloading a game would charge the developer twice](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/13/unity-runtime-fee-policy-marc-whitten). If that alone isn't enough to make you squirm, consider the following:

::: info Tracking

Unity has to track and report the installs somehow. Players are now forcibly opted into a data reporting system. Games made with Unity would now essentially be a form of spyware.

:::

::: info Flubbing

There are numerous reasons, legal or not, why a game may be installed significantly more times than it's purchased. If your game is pirated and being torrented in mass quantities, are you expected to pay for these installs? If you aren't worried about piracy, what's stopping someone that purchased your game legitimately from writing a script that uninstalls and reinstalls your game over and over?

:::

::: info  Trust

Do you trust Unity to distinguish installs that are legitimate from those that are not?

## The Aftermath
Many in the game dev community saw the announcement it as a wake-up call, realizing that when you depend on closed-source software, you are putting yourself in a position where profit-driven corporations can exploit your passions (or your livelihood) to their own ends.

Thanks to the backlash, Unity [backpedalled on these announcements](https://unity.com/pricing-updates) and even expanded features of the engine's free tier, like making the infamous "Made with Unity" splash screen finally optional -- essentially admitting that people want to hide that they use the engine.
