# gamedev

I've been building games since 2020. I use the Godot engine for 2D games and jams, and Unity for more visually-involved 3D projects.

In this sub blog you'll find various engine tips and tricks that I couldn't find elsewhere, updates on my many game projects, and other game dev related thoughts.
